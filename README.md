I have made an contribution in the program by raising a ZeroDivisionError exception when the user attempts to divide a number by 0, instead of printing to the screen.

In this lab, we focused on finding bugs in a Python program, replicating them to see the issue, fixing the issues, and testing the program for any further bugs. During this time, I was responsible for debugging the "add" and "subtract" functions, because they executed the opposite of their what name suggests. They have been successfully debugged and tested by simply changing the operators according to their namesake function.
