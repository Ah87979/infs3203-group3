In this lab, I have contributed to finding bus in the pythin file. Luckily I found 2 of them which is the square root and power functions. We used git bash to record and track our progress, updating each of them to github. The bugs were found when sample test cases were ran. I solved the bug for power function by using the correct symbol aka '**' and added another print statement for square root function to return the square root value of the second input since it'd only execute for the first input as the function takes one paramter only.

I have made an contribution in the program by raising a ZeroDivisionError exception when the user attempts to divide a number by 0, instead of printing to the screen.

In this lab, we focused on finding bugs in a Python program, replicating them to see the issue, fixing the issues, and testing the program for any further bugs. During this time, I was responsible for debugging the "add" and "subtract" functions, because they executed the opposite of their what name suggests. They have been successfully debugged and tested by simply changing the operators according to their namesake function.
