In this lab, I have contributed to finding bus in the python file. Luckily I found 2 of them which is the square root and power functions. We used git bash to record and track our progress, updating each of them to github. The bugs were found when sample test cases were ran. I solved the bug for power function by using the correct symbol aka '**' and added another print statement for square root function to return the square root value of the second input since it'd only execute for the first input as the function takes one paramter only.

In this contribution, I have enhanced the program's error handling by introducing a ZeroDivisionError exception. This exception is raised when the user attempts to divide a number by zero, a common source of runtime errors. Instead of simply printing an error message to the screen, which can be overlooked or ignored, the program now actively alerts the user to this mathematical impossibility.
By raising a ZeroDivisionError exception, the program provides more informative and actionable error messages. Instead of silently continuing execution with incorrect results, the program halts and notifies the user of the division-by-zero attempt. This contribution enhances the overall robustness and reliability of the program by addressing a potential source of runtime errors.
To leverage this enhancement, simply execute the program as usual. If a division by zero is attempted, the program will raise a ZeroDivisionError exception, clearly indicating the issue.

In this lab, we focused on finding bugs in a Python program, replicating them to see the issue, fixing the issues, and testing the program for any further bugs. During this time, I was responsible for debugging the "add" and "subtract" functions, because they executed the opposite of their what name suggests. They have been successfully debugged and tested by simply changing the operators according to their namesake function.
